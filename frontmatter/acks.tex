A project this dispersed and as long as the MATSim project draws on many sources for its support. We hope that we have not forgotten any institution here. 
We are grateful to all of them, which made this open-source effort possible and we hope that they will continue to do so in the spirit of intellectual discovery and sharing. 

In every case we have to thank our home institutions for providing the basic intellectual and computing infrastructure for our work. 
ETH Zürich was home to Prof.~Nagel and his group when he started to project and continues to be the basis for Prof.~Axhausen and his team. 
TU~Berlin became Prof.~Nagel's new platform after his move. 
Both institutions provided support through base funding of staff, servers and data access, which allow us to provide ongoing support to the overall project. 

The following projects and sponsors funded particular persons and implementations:
